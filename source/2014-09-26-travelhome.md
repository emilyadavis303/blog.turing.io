 Users can function both as hosts and travellers.  An example workflow may look 
something like this:

- A traveler comes to the site and browses available listings
- They request to book a listing, at which point the host is notified by email
- The host has the option to confirm or deny a particular booking request
- Should the request be accepted, confirmation is sent to both host and traveler and payment proceeds

More specifically:

Hosts can:

- Create and manage listings
- Confirm and deny booking requests
- See a history of successful visits

Travelers can:

- Browse all listings or listings for a specific host
- Filter by things like price and available dates
- Maintain multiple booking requests over a single order
